#### Problem Statement

A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. To tackle this BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

#### Objective : 
The objective is to predictively model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables which will be used by the management to understand:
1. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
2. How well those variables describe the bike demands 

#### Dataset :
Sample 2 year bike sharing data provided in a csv ('day.csv')

## Conclusions
- The demand prediction of the shared bikes have significant dependancy on the daily temperature, daily windspeed, the year, holiday attributes, seasonal attributes and type of weather attributes
- The humidity, working day, weekday attributes are insignificant in predicting the demand of the shared bikes
